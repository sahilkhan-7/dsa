## Introduction

In this repository, you will find a collection of well-documented and efficient implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository aims to provide you with a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing DSA concepts.

## Data Structures

The `data-structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures such as:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Tree
- Graph
- Hash Table
- and more...

Each data structure is implemented in multiple programming languages, including but not limited to C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. You can explore the respective directories to find the implementation in your preferred language.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory contains implementations of various algorithms such as:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming Algorithms
- and more...

Similar to the data structures, each algorithm is implemented in multiple programming languages. You can navigate to the respective directories to find the implementation in your preferred language.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have any improvements or new implementations to suggest, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines mentioned in the repository.
